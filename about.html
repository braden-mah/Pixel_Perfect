        <p class="description">Hi, my name's Braden, and I'm the head designer and artist for Pixel Perfect! 
        As a pasttime, I love developing video games. However, I found that there just wasn't enough open source
        pixel art available for aspiring game developers to use in their projects on the Internet.  
        That's why I created this website initially! So that game developers could use the art provided here to make visually captivating games.
        If you're not a game dev, don't worry! You can still use this art however you'd like!  Thanks for visiting! </p>
